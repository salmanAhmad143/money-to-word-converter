**************Convert Indian Rupee INR OR USD Into Word ************************

I have created this function in PHP to convert INR and USD currency amount into word. 

For Example :-

Suppose we have an amount like 24500 and now we want to convert this into word like -

"Twenty four thousand five hundred Rupee"  --- INR (Indian Rupee)

"Twenty four thousand five hundred Dollar"  --- USD

What you have to do it you just need to pass this amount with currency in this function and it will return you the amount in word like below -

convertCurrencyInWord(24500, "INR") -- For INR

convertCurrencyInWord(24500, "USD") -- For USD


Thank You
Happy Coding
